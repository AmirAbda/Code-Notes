here for exmple we are given the head of singly linked list 

and a set of items (int values ) 

we want to delete all the element in the orginal linked list that their node's values appear 
in this set 

as we khnow in a linked list we can not access the element(nodes) by index 
so we need to get a pointer for the head and keep traversing the list node by node and 
for each node we cheak if the value of this node is in the set or not oky .. 
it it's present we just update the next pointer to make it point to the next of next 

and then just incrementing the pointer and then repeat the process 
until returning the dummy.next which the refrence of the head of the mutated input linked list oky
